Substitution (Shift, Polyalphabetic) - Transposition (Columnar)

A small project to simulate different classic ciphers. The project was written during my sophomore so the optimization is not really at its best.
Currently, this project has 7 ciphers:
[0]: Caesar Cipher (or Shift Cipher) - the simplest monoalphabetic substitution cipher, using shift constant: y = x + C
[1]: Affine Cipher - monoalphabetic cipher, using linear shift formula with 2 constants: y = Ax + B 
[2]: Vigenere Cipher - polyalphabetic substitution cipher, based on Caesar Cipher, using a keyword
[3]: Autokey Cipher (autoclave) - similar to Vigenere Cipher, but the keyword starts with a primer and new encrypted/decrypted letters are appended after each iteration
[4]: Numeral Cipher - translating to numbers with different bases (binary, hexadecimal, octal,...)
[5]: Columnar Cipher - transposition cipher
[6]: Transposition Cipher -  - transposition cipher
